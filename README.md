# Choose the top fantasy players! :soccer:

In this project I assume that we are a business who sells a very unique product. We provide our customers with a recommended team of players for their Premier League Fantasy teams.

Our recommended team aims to maximize the number of fantasy game points that the customer will receive over the course of the current Premier League season while keeping to a total budget of £100 million. A standard Premier League season consists of 38 gameweeks and typically runs from early-August to early-May. We use our football and fantasy football domain knowledge to guide the data analysis.

### TO-DO List

This is an ongoing project and I expect to add more functionality soon. :thumbsup:

- [x] Create a team and player return on investment (ROI) metric
- [x] Create a multidimensional plot function that visualizes the best players
- [ ] Create function which uses fantasy rules to build team with £100 million
- [ ] Create pipeline to update recommendation based on injuries
