# Choose the top fantasy players!

#### In this project we assume that we are a business who sells a very unique product. We provide our customers with a recommended team of players for their Premier League Fantasy teams.
#### Our recommended team aims to maximize the number of fantasy game points that the customer will receive over the course of the current Premier League season while keeping to a total budget of Â£100 million. A standard Premier League season consists of 38 gameweeks and typically runs from early-August to early-May. We use our football and fantasy football domain knowledge to guide the data analysis.
#### This is an ongoing project and I expect to add more functionality soon.
